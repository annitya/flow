flow
====

An intellij-plugin

Displays an interactive map of caller/callee-functions for your current context.

TODO:

Bind to a more sensible event(s): Only update if:
    1. The "flow" of the application has changed.
    2. The cursor is now in a different method than before.

Validate date the scope/performance of find-reference.
Design/UX.
Some unit-tests would be fun.

DONE:

Convert GUI to a tool-window.
